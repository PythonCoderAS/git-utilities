# Git Utilities

These are small shell scripts I have created to make tedious git procedures not so terrible.

In order to include these scripts into your flow, add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

Shortcut: Any executable in `PATH` starting with `git-$name` can be called via `git $name`.
